# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis comparisons between Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and BERT. 

This project performs sentiment analysis by classifying an entire movie review as positive or negative. We used the imdb dataset as used in the paper below.

1. Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that the presence of each word in a document is conditionally independent of the presence of any other word in that document. Naive Bayes assumes conditional independence of features (fi) given the document's class (c), and the training involves relative-frequency estimation of P(c) and P(fi|c) using add-one smoothing. 

2. Perceptron.

3. BERT.
